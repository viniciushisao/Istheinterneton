# Istheinterneton

This is a tool for Android devices. This application has the ability to say if you are connected or not in a just on click. 

Whe I was working hardly with Android, to check the internet connectivity used to get at least 3 steps

1. Open internet browser (ususally Chrome)
2. Type something to search
3. Push search button and check the resulsts
 
Just after those steps I could guarantee the device could reach internet.
 
Nowadays the Android OS is far more intelligent then when I started to code and you can check connectivity just looking into you connection intevface.

Anyway I created this project to help anyone who is missing an app just like this one!

You can check the stable version at [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hisao.istheinterneton)
